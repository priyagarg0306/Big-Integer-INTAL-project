# Big-Integer-INTAL-project

The purpose of this project is to make a library named "INTAL", to support Big Integers like 10-digit numbers in the C Language i.e. to increase the maximum size limit of string data type that is not there in the C language by default. Also, with the help of this library, operations like Sum, Difference, Multiply, Divide can be performed on this increased maximum size limit of string.
